# Wreck Me

A quick game about projectile motion and wrecking stuff :). All done very last-minute but it has a couple of levels (I intend on adding more!).

### How to use

This game was made in **rust** (yes, rust) - so you need to run it as an exe.
Just download the runnable_for_download zip folder, extract the files to your computer, and run the exe. Don't just download the exe from the runnable folder - that won't work because it needs the images folder which has all the assets in it. 

Happy physicsing! :D
